<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>Lemminkainen, greatly offended that he was not invited to the
wedding, resolves to go to Pohjola, although his mother dissuades him
from it, and warns him of the many dangers that he will have to encounter
(1-382). He sets forth and succeeds in passing all the dangerous places
by his skill in magic (383-776).</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ahti dwelt upon an island,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the bay near Kauko's headland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his fields he tilled industrious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fields he trenched with ploughing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his ears were of the finest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his hearing of the keenest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Heard he shouting in the village,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the lake came sounds of hammering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the ice the sound of footsteps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the heath a sledge was rattling,           <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore in his mind he fancied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his brain the notion entered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That at Pohjola was wedding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a drinking-bout in secret.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mouth and head awry then twisting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his black beard all disordered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his rage the blood departed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the cheeks of him unhappy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at once he left his ploughing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid the field he left the ploughshare,       <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the spot his horse he mounted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he rode directly homeward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his dearest mother's dwelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his dear and aged mother.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he said as he approached her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he called, as he was coming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O my mother, aged woman,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Bring thou food, and bring it quickly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the hungry man may eat it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moody man devour it,                  <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">While they warm the bathroom for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bathroom set in order,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the man may wash and cleanse him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And adorn him like a hero."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then did Lemminkainen's mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring him food, and bring it quickly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the hungry man might eat it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moody man devour it,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And arranged the bathroom for him.            <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the lively Lemminkainen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quickly ate the food she gave him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurried then into the bathroom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hastened quickly to the bathroom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There it was the finch now washed him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the bullfinch washed and cleansed him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Washed his head to flaxen whiteness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his throat to shining whiteness.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From the bath the room he entered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he spoke the words which follow:          <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O my mother, aged woman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek the storehouse on the mountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring me thence my shirt, the fine one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Likewise bring the finest clothing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I now may put it on me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And may fitly clothe me in it."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But his mother asked him quickly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asked him thus, the aged woman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Whither goes my son, my dearest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost thou go to hunt the lynxes,              <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to chase the elk on snowshoes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or perchance to shoot a squirrel?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>Lemminkainen comes to Pohjola and behaves with the greatest
insolence (1-204). The Lord of Pohjola grows angry, and as he can do
nothing against Lemminkainen by magic, he challenges him to a duel
(205-282). In the course of the duel Lemminkainen strikes off the
head of the Lord of Pohjola, and to avenge this, the Mistress of Pohjola
raises an army against him (283-420).</p>

<p>Lemminkainen escapes with all speed from Pohjola, comes home
and asks his mother where he can hide himself from the people of
Pohjola, who will soon attack him in his home, a hundred to one
(1-164). His mother reproaches him for his expedition to Pohjola,
suggests various places of concealment, and at length advises him to go
far across the lakes to a distant island, where his father once lived in
peace during a year of great war (165-294).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>Lemminkainen sails across the lakes in his boat and comes safely to
the island (1-180). There he lives pleasantly among the girls and
women till the return of the men from warfare, who conspire against
him (181-290). Lemminkainen flies from the island, much to the grief
both of the girls and himself (291-402). His boat is wrecked in
a violent storm, but he escapes by swimming to land, makes a new
boat, and arrives safely on the shores of his own country (403-452).
He finds his old house burned, and the whole surroundings laid waste,
when he begins to weep and lament, especially for the loss of his mother
(453-514). His mother, however, is still alive, having taken refuge in
a thick forest where Lemminkainen finds her to his great joy (515-546).
She relates how the army of Pohjola came and burned down the house.
Lemminkainen promises to build a finer house after he has revenged
himself upon the people of Pohjola, and describes his pleasant life in the
island of refuge (547-602).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>Lemminkainen goes to ask his former comrade-in-arms, Tiera, to
join him in an expedition against Pohjola (1-122). The Mistress of
Pohjola sends the Frost against them, who freezes the boat in the
sea, and almost freezes the heroes themselves in the boat, but that
Lemminkainen restrains it by powerful charms and invocations (123-316).
Lemminkainen and his companion walk across the ice to the
shore, wander about in the waste for a long time in a miserable plight,
and at last make their way home (317-500).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>Untamo wages war against his brother Kalervo, overthrows Kalervo
and his army, sparing only a single pregnant woman of the whole clan.
She is carried away to Untamo's people, and gives birth to her son
Kullervo (1-82). Kullervo resolves in his cradle to take revenge on
Untamo, and Untamo attempts several times to put him to death, but
without success (83-202). When Kullervo grows up, he spoils all his
work, and therefore Untamo sells him as a slave to Ilmarinen (203-374).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>While Kullervo is in the pasture in the afternoon he tries to cut the
cake with his knife which he completely spoils, and this goes to his heart
the more because the knife was the only remembrance left to him of
his family (1-98). To revenge himself on the mistress, he drives the
cattle into the marshes to be devoured by beasts of the forest, and
gathers together a herd of wolves and bears, which he drives home in
the evening (99-184). When the mistress goes to milk them she is
torn to pieces by the wild beasts (185-296).</p>

the Forest, who informs him that his father, mother, brothers and
sisters are still living (1-128). Following her directions he finds them
on the borders of Lapland (129-188). His mother tells him that she
had long supposed him to be dead, and also that her elder daughter had
been lost when gathering berries (189-246).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>Kullervo attempts to do different kinds of work for his parents, but
only succeeds in spoiling everything, so his father sends him to pay
the land-dues (1-68). On his way home he meets his sister who
was lost gathering berries, whom he drags into his sledge (69-188).
Afterwards, when his sister learns who he is, she throws herself into a
torrent, but Kullervo hurries home, relates his sister's terrible fate to his
mother, and proposes to put an end to his own life (189-344). His
mother dissuades him from suicide, and advises him to retire to some
retreat where he may be able to recover from his remorse. But
Kullervo resolves before all things to avenge himself on Untamo
(345-372).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>Kullervo prepares for war and leaves home joyfully, for no one but
his mother is sorry that he is going to his death (1-154). He comes to
Untamola, lays waste the whole district, and burns the homestead
(155-250). On returning home he finds his home deserted, and no
living thing about the place but an old black dog, with which he goes
into the forest to shoot game for food (251-296). While traversing the
forest he arrives at the place where he met his sister, and ends his
remorse by killing himself with his own sword (297-360).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>Ilmarinen weeps long for his dead wife and then forges himself a
wife of gold and silver with great labour and trouble (1-162). At night
he rests by the golden bride, but finds in the morning that the side which
he has turned towards her is quite cold (163-196). He offers his golden
bride to Väinämöinen, who declines to receive her, and advises him to
forge more useful things, or to send her to other countries where people
wish for gold (197-250).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>Ilmarinen goes to Pohjola to woo the younger sister of his first wife,
but as he receives only insulting words in reply, he becomes angry,
seizes the maiden, and starts on his homeward journey (1-124). On
the way the maiden treats Ilmarinen with contempt, and provokes him
till he changes her into a seagull (125-286). When Ilmarinen comes
home, he relates to Väinämöinen how the inhabitants of Pohjola live
free from care since they possessed the Sampo; and also tells him how
badly his wooing has prospered (287-328).</p>

<p>Väinämöinen persuades Ilmarinen to go with him to Pohjola to
bring away the Sampo. Ilmarinen consents, and the heroes start off
on their journey in a boat (1-330). Lemminkainen hails them from
the shore, and on hearing where they are going, proposes to join them,
and is accepted as a third comrade (331-426).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>The heroes arrive at Pohjola, and Väinämöinen announces that he has
come to take possession of the Sampo, either with good-will, or by
force (1-58). The Mistress of Pohjola refuses to yield it either by
consent or by compulsion, and calls together her people to oppose him
(59-64). Väinämöinen takes the kantele, begins to play, and lulls to
sleep all the people of Pohjola, and goes with his companions to search
for the Sampo; they take it from the stone mountain and convey it
to the boat (65-164). They sail homewards well satisfied, carrying
the Sampo with them (165-308). On the third day the Mistress of
Pohjola wakes from her sleep, and when she finds that the Sampo has
been carried off, she prepares a thick fog, a strong wind, and other
impediments, to oppose the robbers of the Sampo, which reach the
vessel, and during the tempest Väinämöinen's kantele falls into the
water (309-562).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>The Mistress of Pohjola equips a war-vessel and goes in pursuit
of the robbers of the Sampo (1-22). When she overtakes them a
fight ensues between the forces of Pohjola and Kalevala in which the
latter conquer (23-258). Nevertheless the Mistress of Pohjola succeeds
in dragging the Sampo from the boat into the lake, where it breaks to
pieces (259-266). The larger portions sink in the lake, and form its
riches, while the smaller pieces are thrown on shore by the waves, at
which Väinämöinen is much pleased (267-304). The Mistress of
Pohjola threatens to send all evil upon Kalevala, to which Väinämöinen
pays no attention (305-368). The Mistress of Pohjola returns home in
great distress, taking with her only a small fragment of the cover of the
Sampo (369-384). Väinämöinen carefully collects the fragments of the
Sampo on the shore, and plants them, hoping for continuous good fortune
(385-434).</p>

<p>The moon and sun descend to listen to Väinämöinen's playing. The
Mistress of Pohjola succeeds in capturing them, hides them in a mountain,
and steals the fire from the homes of Kalevala (1-40). Ukko, the
Supreme God, is surprised at the darkness in the sky, and kindles fire
for a new moon and a new sun (41-82). The fire falls to the ground,
and Väinämöinen and Ilmarinen go to search for it (83-126). The
Virgin of the Air informs them that the fire has fallen into Lake Alue,
and has been swallowed by a fish (127-312). Väinämöinen and
Ilmarinen try to catch the fish with a net of bast, but without success
(313-364).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>The heroes prepare a linen net, and at length capture the fish which
has swallowed the fire (1-192). The fire is found in the fish's belly,
but flashes up suddenly, and burns Ilmarinen's cheeks and hands
severely (193-248). The fire rushes into the forest, burns over many
countries, and spreads further and further, till at length it is captured
and carried to the dark dwellings of Kalevala (249-290). Ilmarinen
recovers from his burns (291-372).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>Ilmarinen forges a new moon and sun but cannot make them shine
(1-74). Väinämöinen discovers by divination that the moon and sun
are hidden in the mountain of Pohjola, goes to Pohjola and conquers
the whole nation (75-230). He sees the moon and sun in the
mountain, but cannot enter (231-278). He returns home to procure tools
with which to break open the mountain. While Ilmarinen is forging
them, the Mistress of Pohjola, fearing that it may go ill with her, releases
the moon and sun (279-362). When Väinämöinen sees the moon and sun
reappear in the sky, he salutes them, hoping that they will always go
brightly on their course, and bring happiness to the country (363-422).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>The virgin Marjatta swallows a cranberry and brings forth a boy
(1-346). The child disappears and is found after a long search in a
swamp (347-430). He is taken to an old man to be baptized, but the
latter will not baptize the fatherless child until after due consideration
(431-440). Väinämöinen comes to inquire into the matter, and
advises that the ill-omened boy should be put to death, but the child
reproaches him for his unjust sentence (441-474). The old man
baptizes the boy as King of Carelia, at which Väinämöinen is grievously
offended and leaves the country, but first declares that he
will again make a new Sampo and kantele, and light for the people.
He sails away in a copper boat to a land between earth and heaven,
but he leaves behind his kantele and his great songs as a parting gift to
his people (475-512). Concluding verses (513-620).</p>

<p><a href="#R30_p65_l389">389.</a> The unmanly lamentations of the heroes over a fate that has not
befallen them may remind us of Grimm's story of "Die kluge Else."
It will also be noticed that the heroes are only concerned about their
mothers; and Tiera has as little thought for his virgin bride as
Lemminkainen has for Kyllikki.</p>


<p class="censec">RUNO XXXI</p>

<p><a href="#R31_p68_l1">1.</a> The tragedy of Kullervo is the favourite episode of the <i>Kalevala</i>
in Finland, next to that of Aino. The preamble (lines 1-10) is the
same as the opening of the Esthonian <i>Kalevipoeg</i>. The story of the
Esthonian hero, though he was a king and not a slave, resembles that
of Kullervo in so many respects that he must have been the same
character originally.</p>

<p><a href="#R31_p69_l19">19.</a> I think the change of style, indicative of different authorship, in
this episode is sufficiently obvious even in a translation. Many words
used here do not occur earlier in the poem.</p>

<p><a href="#R31_p71_l91-96">91-96.</a> The same story is told of the infant Kalevipoeg.</p>

<p><a href="#R31_p71_l107">107.</a> Esthonians call dwarfs "Ox-knee people"; <i>i. e.</i> people as high
as an ox's knee.</p>

<p><a href="#R31_p72_l137">137.</a> Like Simple Simon.</p>

<p><a href="#R31_p77_l337">337.</a> It is obvious that some of the youthful exploits of Kwasind
(slightly varied, after Longfellow's manner) are imitated from those of
Kullervo. (Compare also Runo XXXV., 11-68.)</p>


<p class="censec">RUNO XXXII</p>

<p><a href="#R32_p78_l24">24.</a> The rye-bread, on which the Finnish peasants largely subsist, is
described as baked in very hard round loaves, like quoits, which are
strung on a pole. But Kullervo's cake seems to have been prepared to
look nice on the outside.</p>

<p><a href="#R32_p82_l156-162">156-162.</a> Does this refer to stories of witches milking cattle?</p>

<p><a href="#R32_p83_l206">206.</a> Of juniper wood.</p>

<p><a href="#R32_p90_l498">498.</a> Literally, an apple-berry. Probably a small crab-apple is
intended.</p>

<p><a href="#R32_p91_l513">513.</a> I think wolves are here intended, not dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>
<p><a href="#R32_p91_l533">533.</a> In the Esthonian story of the Northern Frog, the monster is
secured by an iron stake driven through the jaws. (Kirby's <i>Hero of
Esthonia</i>, II., 253, 256.)</p>

<p><a href="#R32_p91_l542">542.</a> These elaborate and ineffectual prayers and incantations may
be compared with the prayers of Achilles for the safety of Patroclus, in
<i>Iliad</i>, XVI.</p>


<p class="censec">RUNO XXXIII</p>

<p><a href="#R33_p93_l40">40.</a> Wheat is used in the folk-songs as a term of endearment.
(K. K.)</p>

<p><a href="#R33_p93_l61-62">61, 62.</a> The Esthonian Kalevipoeg was constantly instructed by the
voice of birds.</p>

<p><a href="#R33_p99_l285-290">285-290.</a> In Esthonia this episode occurs in the story of the Royal
Herdboy. (<i>Hero of Esthonia</i>, I., pp. 279-305.)</p>


<p class="censec">RUNO XXXV</p>

<p><a href="#R35_p108_l65">65.</a> As Kalervo appears to have been a chief in his own right, it
not very clear why, or to whom, he had to pay taxes.</p>

<p><a href="#R35_p109_l107-108">107, 108.</a> The lake of course was frozen.</p>

<p><a href="#R35_p110_l153">153.</a> As in several other instances in the <i>Kalevala</i>, this does not
appear to be abduction in the modern sense, but merely marriage by
capture.</p>

<p><a href="#R35_p112_l214">214.</a> There is another celebrated poem written by a Finn, but in
Swedish, Runeberg's <i>Kong</i> (King) <i>Fjalar</i>, in which a similar chance
meeting between a brother and sister forms the principal subject.</p>

<p><a href="#R35_p115_l343">343.</a> Sea-beasts are very rarely mentioned in the <i>Kalevala</i>, for nearly
all aquatic animals referred to are lake- or river-fish. Here the allusion
is probably to the story of Jonah.</p>


<p class="censec">RUNO XXXVI</p>

<p><a href="#R36_p118_l80">80.</a> Literally "the rest of his flesh." Having regard to the supposed
powers of Finnish magicians, this passage is not to be taken merely as
an impudent rejoinder, but as asserting powers which Kullervo actually
claimed to be able to exert.</p>

<p><a href="#R36_p124_l307">307.</a> In an old English romance we read concerning the suicide of a
sorcerer, "The ground whereon he died was ever afterwards unfortunate,
and to this present time it is called in that country, 'a vale of walking
spirits.'" (<i>Seven Champions of Christendom</i>, Part I., chap. xix.)</p>

<p><a href="#R36_p124_l327">327.</a> This reminds us of Sir Peter's "Sword of Vengeance." (Prior's
<i>Danish Ballads</i>, I., pp. 269-275.)</p>

<p><a href="#R36_p125_l341">341.</a> The Esthonian Kalevipoeg was also slain, like Kullervo, by his
own sword. (<i>Hero of Esthonia</i>, I., pp. 140, 141.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>
<p class="censec">RUNO XXXVII</p>

<p><a href="#R37_p127_l56">56.</a> Literally, their hatless shoulders.</p>

<p><a href="#R37_p127_l61">61.</a> Compare the account of the forging of the Sampo in Runo X.</p>


<p class="censec">RUNO XXXVIII</p>

<p><a href="#R38_p134_l94">94.</a> This might allude to the Viking practice of carving the Blood-Eagle
on the backs of enemies; but Prof. Krohn remarks that this was
unknown in Finland.</p>

<p><a href="#R38_p138_l255">255.</a> Here it seems that the mere fact of Ilmarinen having carried off
the girl, even against her will, was enough to constitute her his lawful
wife.</p>

<p><a href="#R38_p139_l273">273.</a> Ilmarinen's sword was less bloodthirsty than that of Kullervo;
but it will be noticed that there is as little real chivalry in the <i>Kalevala</i>
generally as in old Scandinavian literature.</p>


<p class="censec">RUNO XL</p>

<p><a href="#R40_p159_l274">274.</a> Literally, "at the tips of my ten nails."</p>


<p class="censec">RUNO XLI</p>

<p><a href="#R41_p167_l238">238.</a> Similar incidents are common in folktales. The reader will
recollect the decoration of Mama, the Woodpecker. (<i>Hiawatha</i>, IX.)</p>


<p class="censec">RUNO XLII</p>

<p><a href="#R42_p168_l1-3">1-3.</a> Here again we notice a difference of expression, indicating a
different authorship.</p>

<p><a href="#R42_p169_l52">52.</a> "Mistress of the mighty spell." (Southey.)</p>

<p><a href="#R42_p172_l146">146.</a> Compare Runo XX., lines 17-118.</p>

<p><a href="#R42_p175_l295">295.</a> Literally, his finger-bones.</p>

<p><a href="#R42_p178_l403">403.</a> Perhaps the cap had ear-flaps to be worn in bad weather.</p>


<p class="censec">RUNO XLIII</p>

<p><a href="#R43_p183_l37-38">37, 38.</a> This seems to be meant ironically.</p>

<p><a href="#R43_p185_l115-120">115-120.</a> This, or something similar, is a common device for impeding
a pursuer in European fairy tales.</p>

<p><a href="#R43_p187_l177">177.</a> Pohjan eukko. Another epithet for Louhi.</p>

<p><a href="#R43_p192_l383-384">383, 384.</a> The Sampo being not only an unfailing corn, salt, and
money-mill, but a palladium of general prosperity, Pohjola would
naturally fall into famine and misery when nothing remained but an
almost worthless fragment of the cover. It is possible that the story
may refer to some great and permanent change for the worse of the
climate of the North; either during the storms and earthquakes of the
fourteenth century, which would connect it with the plague described in
Runo XLV.; or perhaps to a much earlier period, when, as old Persian
books tell us, the climate of some part of Asia (?) was changed from nine
months summer and three months winter, to nine months winter and
three months summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>
<p class="censec">RUNO XLV</p>

<p><a href="#R45_p203_l41">41.</a> Loviatar represents the evil and destructive powers of Nature, as
opposed to the beneficent powers, represented in the <i>Kalevala</i> under
the twin aspects of Ilmatar and Marjatta.</p>

<p><a href="#R45_p205_l117">117.</a> This speech or invocation is not addressed to Loviatar, but
apparently to some goddess similar to the Roman Lucina.</p>

<p><a href="#R45_p207_l168">168.</a> Dr. Russell says that the itch was more dreaded than the plague
in Aleppo in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p><a href="#R45_p207_l181">181.</a> Pestilence has often been attributed to the anger of gods or
demons; and Finland suffered severely from plague till well into the
eighteenth century. But I am inclined to regard the plague described
here as the Black Death, which must have ravaged Finland about 1350.</p>

<p><a href="#R45_p209_l269-282-283">269, 282, 283.</a> All these names have nearly the same significance, and
might be rendered by "Dolores, our Lady of Pain."</p>


<p class="censec">RUNO XLVI</p>

<p><a href="#R46_p212_l13-14">13, 14.</a> The pestilence having abated at the approach of winter, the
wild beasts naturally overran the devastated country. So I would
interpret this passage.</p>

<p><a href="#R46_p212_l25">25.</a> Literally, three feathers, but the commentary gives the meaning
adopted above.</p>

<p><a href="#R46_p214_l81">81.</a> For an account of bear-hunting in Finland, compare Acerbi's
<i>Voyage to the North Cape</i>, I., pp. 288, 289.</p>

<p><a href="#R46_p216_l168">168.</a> Tapio is the lord of the forest here alluded to, according to the
commentary.</p>

<p><a href="#R46_p218_l246">246.</a> The word here rendered "charge" literally means "bundle"
or "package."</p>

<p><a href="#R46_p220_l313">313.</a> Probably the Danish Sound.</p>

<p><a href="#R46_p221_l377">377.</a> A honeyed forest perhaps means a forest abounding in honey-dew.</p>

son of Jumala. (<i>Kanteletar</i>, III., 2; translated by Mr. C. J. Billson,
<i>Folklore</i>, VI., 343, 344.)</p>

<p><a href="#R47_p229_l37">37.</a> Compare the story of Maui stealing the fire in New Zealand

<p><a href="#R47_p234_l233">233.</a> Does this refer to tides? Tides can hardly be known in

<p class="censec">RUNO L</p>

<p><a href="#R50_p259_l1">1.</a> Marjatta korea kuopus.</p>

<p>Literally, Marjatta the elegant darling; an expression occurring nowhere
else in the <i>Kalevala</i>. The story in the present Runo seems to
exhibit a veneer of Christianity over Shaman legends. Even the name
Marjatta, notwithstanding its resemblance to Maria, seems to be really
derived from the word marja, a berry. An old writer says that the
favourite deities of the Finns in his time were Väinämöinen and the
Virgin Mary.</p>

<p><a href="#R50_p264_l188">188.</a> That is, a criminal who deserves to be burnt at the stake.</p>

<p><a href="#R50_p264_l199-200">199, 200.</a> She already recognizes her unborn son as an Avatar.</p>

<p><a href="#R50_p266_l289">289.</a> The word here rendered "hapless" properly means "little."</p>

<p><a href="#R50_p271_l465">465.</a> This is the only passage in the <i>Kalevala</i> in which Väinämöinen
is spoken of as ever having been young; though he is occasionally
called young in variants.</p>

<p><a href="#R50_p271_l465-468">465-468.</a> This passage apparently alludes to Väinämöinen having
sent Ilmarinen to Pohjola by a trick.</p>

<p><a href="#R50_p271_l471-474">471-474.</a> This must allude either to the fate of Aino, or to some
story not included in the <i>Kalevala</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#R50_p271_l501">501.</a> In Esthonian legends, Vanemuine is not an Avatar and
culture-hero, but the God of Music, who withdrew from men on
account of the ribaldry with which some of his hearers received his
divine songs. (<i>Hero of Esthonia</i>, II., pp. 80-85.) Longfellow also
makes Hiawatha depart in a boat after the conclusion of his mission.</p>

<p><a href="#R50_p274_l613-614">613, 614.</a> These expressions remind us of the Buddha "breaking
down the rafters and the roof-tree" preparatory to reaching Nirvano.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
